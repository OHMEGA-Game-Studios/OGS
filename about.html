                            Omega Game Studios is a small game development studio that was founded in 2021. 
                            Formerly known as MegaBox Game Studios, we have been developing games for over 7 years.
                            Still working on our first public game, The Ruined Manifest. You will enjoy playing it
                            as much as we have enjoyed making it.

                        <h1>About Our Game</h1>

                        <p>
                            The Ruined Manifest is a survival horror game, this game is set in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State.
                            We are calling it the Thrashaw Hills. This game will tell a story about a Natural event that has caused the forest
                            to grow so massive. This event is nammed The Ruined Manifest. This game will be available for PC, MAC on first release.
                            Though later in development Linux will be added to our support list.

                            <li><p>Will The Ruined Manifest work on my laptop?</p></li>
                            <h4>Answer: It depends, 
                                The Ruined Manifest is made in Unreal Engine 5 and requires a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 
                                a pretty good GPU. However the game will be tested on ALL platforms that it is available for. 
                                Just be careful with the PC option we cannot garuntee that it will work on all PC's. However
                                most MACS should be able to run it.

                            Ohm.IO will be the Game Launcher in which we are going to create once The Ruined Manifest
                            is out of its pre-release stage. Ohm.IO will also be the hub for ALL future games we publish.
                            For now Ohm.IO is just a placeholder for the future. We are currently working on the website
                            which is where you will be able to download our pre-release games. You can expect to see Ohm.IO
                            sometime around late 2025.

                            The Ruined Manifest will be in a full-release by late 2025 and will be available on Steam, Itch.io,

                            also be able to view the Game on our laucher. Ohm.IO. This will be predicted to be released as $20.00. However
                            that CAN change in the future and is just a placeholder for now.

                            Our website is still currently under development, we are currently working on fixing up our website
                            for the future, However we DO plan to release our first game regardless. We plan to fix up some of the styling
                            and add some other things to it. For now though we are going to continue working on the game to publish here.
                            This website will continue to be under development, by September of 2024 we plan to have a fully functional website.
                            You can see ALL of our new updates and posts here and even download our early access games here.

                            Portfolio and art directoy, we are going to be posting our portfolio/art directory on our Portfolio page.
                            This will contain all of our future games and art work. This will be a great place to take a look into Omega Game Studios
                            and see how we developed our games. And how to get into Game Development yourself. We will also be posting our art directory 
                            here, this is where you can find renders and references that we create for our game. This will contain artifacts and 
                            inspiration boards from the journey of The Ruined Manifest and how the game started. This will also be a great place
                            for you to find inspiration to jumpstart you own game development journey.

                            Console support, we are planning to add console support to The Ruined Manifest
                            around release 2.0.0. We are unsure if this will actually be an update to make it into the game,
                            however it is still a possibility despite ambiguity. We are currently working on the PC and MAC versions
                            for now and CAN garuntee linux support in version 1.0.0.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Linux support, in order to run our game on linux you will need our linux launcher. This will be different from our Windows and MAC launcher.
                            Just because of the support differences in operating systems.
