                    <h2>How I Started</h2>
                </center>
                <p>
                    It all started in 2017. I was getting bored, all I did was play Minecraft.
                    I wanted to do something more. I would remember wandering around the empty world
                    and think to myself, "I wish there was more.". I got into modding the game. This was a very complex 
                    task for me. I would always play with other peoples mods. But I thought I could never do that. Until
                    I discovered a sweet little program called MCreator. MCreator is a visual modding program for Minecraft.
                    I would start playing around with MCreator and realized that I can actually make real mods with this.
                    I finally made my first mod to the game, it wasnt that good but I was happy. After countless hours of
                    working, and google searching, I finally made something
                    I can call my own. Later I got even further into modding the actual client of the game. I would learn
                    Java and use a software called MCP(Minecraft Coder Pack), this would be decompiled code for the game.
                    I could use this to make my own modifications to the client. I would get into switching out the 
                    regular rendering pipeline(OpenGL) for Vulkan! This was quite simple because LWJGL(Light Weight Java Game Library)
                    already supports vulkan, so all I had to do was switch out the rendering code for some of my own code.

                    I made some sweet lighting for the game and it felt like a mid-teer unity game, I would go off to make some of my own
                    shaders for my game, this would add actual post-processing to the game. I would later incorperate my previous mod into 
                    the game and it was awesome. This is what rooted my passion for game development. Overtime I was going through the Python Language
                    and making little bad games with Pygame. It was really fun to do and I would show my peers at school.

                    <h2>I Got into C#</h2>
                </center>
                
                <p>
                    Later I got into C#, this however was not primarily for Game Development, but it striked an interesting idea in my head.
                    I can make GUI apps now with C# and I thought making a simple Windows Forms Game would be cool. I tried and tried but it didnt work.
                    I always thought I could do it easier that way. But I was wrong.
                </p>

                <h4>I Discovered Unity</h4>

                <p>
                    I thought that maybe if I install the Games with .NET package in my Visual Studio maybe it will have some
                    special libraries in it for me to make games easier.

                    No, it had something more powerful.

                    It installed and I looked around in Visual Studio for a while and found nothing new.
                    I felt defeated, I looked around on my computer for a while and found a little app called "Unity". 
                    I remembered I used to play games with the Made in Unity Splash screen All the time. My dad would always point out 
                    how unity has such a bad rep. I thought to myself, but wait! is Unity really that bad? 
                    I opened it and was stunned! It was a 3D games Icon! I can do what Ive wanted to do forever! I can make 3D games!

                    I was urgent to look into this, I clicked on the 3D games tab and gave my game a random name. I dont even remember
                    what it was. I was just so happy, it was loading in the editor then I realized I was in an empty scene with two icons and
                    a sky. The first thing I noticed however was the sky looked better than any minecraft sky I ever saw.

                    I thought to myself, I can make such realistic games! I looked around the editor for a second.
                    I didnt find anything to write code or make an object though. I was confused. I looked up a tutorial
                    and came accross Brackeys. I watched his tutorial series on how to make a simple game in Unity.

                    And there it is, my first game. A stupid little game where I can move a cube around and dodge the obstacles.
                    I was so happy however, I even showed my parents! They were so happy! They even were having quite a bit of fun.
                    We still laugh to this day about how I got the speed paramaters of the cube messed up. They loved the game so much though.
                    I was so happy with it, I thought I never had to make a game again. But I did, I got into a Game Design course and 
                    I then got into 2D design! This was a little harder and I ended up dropping out, however I realized I learned something!
                    I learned how Unity does 2D work! I tried doing some 2D games until I got bored.
                    This was really fun, I realized though I wanted to do something bigger with the knowledge I gained over 3 years.

                <p>
                    After 3 years, and countless Google Searches and way too much time on my hands. I thought to myself, I want to make a real game finally.
                    I thought up the craziest Idea. I didn't know what to name it though. I thought of a silly name, the name was Hallowmore. It was not a very good name,
                    However it worked to impress. It is still 2021, January of 2021 and My game is beginning development. The game was simple. When I thought of it
                    Minecraft like mechanics came to mind with Genshin Impact style graphics. I thought this was the best Idea anyone might have ever come up with!
                    I explored the fun world of Digital Realestate and found some cool assets by Kellys Assets. These fit the Art Style I wanted pretty well and I was 
                    ready to create. I started in Unity with a Simple Terrain System and Some Trees I made in Blender. These trees didnt look too good but they worked.
                    I spent Hours creating this terrain, textures and all. I would send my parents the renders and they thought it looked so great.
                    I added the Standard Assets FPS controller to move around the map and it was so cool. I realized preformance was taking a dump, however I still thought it was great.
                    Though it was a little bit on the low end spectrum of games I was proud of it. There were not any mechanics in place but I was so happy with the render I put it out on Itch.IO.
                    This was the first idea I thought of though. I recently removed it however because I thought up a better Idea. I still didnt know what to call this one yet.
                    I Knew of Manifest and knew I wanted a sad game. My first thought was Ruined Manifest and that name stuck for a whole year! I thought of a more realistic game with 
                    some more realistic mechanics.

                    I started in Unity and continued with the terrain tool until I got the perfect terrain.I never did. But I still got some that looked good in the moment.
                    I would go on to add some terrain details like windy trees and grass, rocks and cliffs, and better lighting.

                    I would never end up actually making the game look good though because I would always get bored and move on to something else. I would always come back to it though.
                    Later I started using SpeedTree to make better plants. It has been about 2 years since I started the game. I recently changed the name for the final time
                    to be The Ruined Manifest. This game will be good. I always tell myself. I read though that Unity changed their policy. I was so disappointed. I thought I could never make a game again in Unity.
                    I started looking for Alternatives and I thought of using Unreal Engine 5. So I am now compleating the Build of The Ruined Manifest in Unreal Engine 5. Finally I am proud to announce
                    that The Ruined Manifest can see a full release in 2025 for PC, Mac and Linux. I am so happy with the progress I have made and I am so happy to see the game come to life.
